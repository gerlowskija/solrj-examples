# SolrJ Examples

A set of examples intended to show how SolrJ should be used in certain situations.  It's intended only as a personal version-controlled scratchpad.  Please consult Solr's Reference Guide for any and all information before looking for help in these examples.  In fact, any helpful examples should eventually be folded back into the Reference Guide as the canonical, community-supported documentation.
